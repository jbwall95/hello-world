# hello-world
The first of many I hope...

Howdy howdy!

My name is Blake. Slowly but surely trying to learn code so I can work at home. I'm a 21 year old with an anxiety issue that won't alow me to drive. I live out in the boondocks, so that means its hard to get a ride places, but I am determind to still support myself somehow. Hoping this is the answer.
